# FollowMe
A Project Tango App to detect objects in the walking path of the user
The FollowMe team began the project without any knowledge of the Project Tango device and little knowledge of the Java language.  With so much uncertainty, it was expected to be a very difficult but very educational task.  From square one, our team began to read in and out about all aspects of the device.  Unfortunately, being a brand new beta device, there was very little documentation, therefore, exploration and testing was crucial throughout the entire process.  Without knowing the device capabilities and limitations, we were eventually able to learn where the received points were stored and we knew that was a large breakthrough of our exploration.  After countless attempts leading to failure, our team was finally able to create a reasonable solution in order to receive the desired outcome from the application.  Being originally an exploration project with the bleak hope of actually creating an application, our team is thoroughly excited that we were able to make our desired application the best we believe possible with the current tango limitations.
