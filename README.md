### Mission
To aid the visually impaired utilizing a Project Tango device <br>

### Problem Statement
There is currently a lack of technology in place to easily and affordably aid the visually impaired in completing simple daily tasks. We as a society still have the same aid standards as we did decades ago. With the exponential growth in technological capabilities, a new system needs to be implemented that utilizes all the great technology and helps the visually impaired navigate without somebodys assistance.

### Problem Resolution
Enter Project Tango. Thanks to this new technology we now have the means to produce a product that can effectively and affordably aid the visually impaired in the 21st century. Project Tango is designed to give mobile devices a human-scale understanding of space and motion. Project tango presents an excellent opportunity to help visually impaired people navigate an area without assistance. 

### Discussion
The FollowMe team began the project without any knowledge of the Project Tango device and little knowledge of the Java language.  With so much uncertainty, it was expected to be a very difficult but very educational task.  From square one, our team began to read in and out about all aspects of the device.  Unfortunately, being a brand new beta device, there was very little documentation, therefore, exploration and testing was crucial throughout the entire process.  Without knowing the device capabilities and limitations, we were eventually able to learn where the received points were stored and we knew that was a large breakthrough of our exploration.  After countless attempts leading to failure, our team was finally able to create a reasonable solution in order to receive the desired outcome from the application.  Being originally an exploration project with the bleak hope of actually creating an application, our team is thoroughly excited that we were able to make our desired application the best we believe possible with the current tango limitations.
